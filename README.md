# Micro Nord Colors

A [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) colorscheme port for the [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/index.html) editor.

**IMPORTANT**

Due to the way micro currently works (or at least my understanding of it), you will need to run the `nordsetup` command once after installation to move the colorscheme files to the correct location. This will manually create the colorschemes directory and move all four themes over.

See the help file for other issues, such as off colors or no transparency.

## Features

Two new color schemes, supporting both true-color and 16-color versions. The 16-color versions require that the terminal has the Nord colorscheme installed, and support transparency (if the terminal and compositor are configured for it).
